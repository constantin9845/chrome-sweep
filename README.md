# To Do

****

**Use persistent noise instead of direct spoof?**

**still exposed data on navigator:**

- window size [50/50]
- timezone 
- canvas (deny canvas creation) [existing canvases blocked, block creation too?]

****

**Language Detection**

- Intl API [done]
- Accept-language header (server side, need proxy) [X]

****

**OS detection**

- CSS media queries (prefers-* queries) 
- Installed fonts (JS & Flash) -> disable in settings


****

**Hardware and performace detection**

- WebGLRenderer -> need spoof [partially done, need test on fresh device] 
- Web Audio API  



****

**Network & Connections**

- IP address -> block all requests (proxy)
- WebRTC -> disable in settings


****

**Other**

- Remove ActiveX, Flash
- system uptime
- mouse and touch vent analysis 


## List all data a website is trying to collect

## Let user set own navigator values
